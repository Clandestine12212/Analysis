# Analysis

The approach being followed is very straightforward in the interest of time

- Perform some initial analysis on the data
- Pick two models; compare the results from both
- Pick the better model based on the inference
- Create a workflow/pipeline/function which can attach the model to itself; load in data and then output the result (Sorted in likelihood)
